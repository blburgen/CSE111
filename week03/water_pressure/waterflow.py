    Write a Python program that asks the user for five numbers:

    tower_height
    tank_height
    length of supply pipe from tank to lot
    quantity 90degree angles
    Length of pipe from supply to house
    
    return the pressure at the house
    
    Enhancements:
    Added constants WATER_DENSITY, EARTH_GRAVITY, and WATER_VISCOSITY
    function to convert kPa to psi
    test function to convert kPa to psi
    loop to ask if the user would like to do another calculation
