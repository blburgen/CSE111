CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
    "Brady's Art Information"
2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
    * it will calculate the price of a piece of art based on size and artist's years of experience
    * it will write information to a text file to store information about the art
    * it will retrive the information from the file that has stored information about the art
    * it will search the information in the file
3. What will you learn from developing this program?
    * how to build an intergrated program
    * better understanding of what I have already learned

4. What Python modules will your program use?
    * datetime
    * pytest
    * csv

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?
    * read_dictionary(file_name, index) return dictionary
    * write_to_file(file_name, file_dict) return null
    * calculate_art_cost(width, length, skill=0) return float
    * search_dictionary(file_dict, input_word) return list

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
    * test_read_dictionary
    * test_calculate_art_cost
    * test_search_dictionary
